# Budgeting-Made-Simple

Author - Jonathon Irwin



This is the initial project, being written in Python due to familiarity with the language, which I intend to eventually recreate in a different language for mobile and PC apps once I have indentified key features and functionality, combined with the logic behind such requirements.

I wish to create a simple, easy to use yet useful budgetting tool. This is based off the theory previously followed which used Jars or Evelopes to budget money as it came in for different future bills and categories. With the shift to virtual currency in bank accounts, and a lack of sufficient tools in these institutions, I have decided to make this program.

Current Features:
  - Period income entry
  - Category creation and assignment
  - Unallocated funds go to other category
  - Increment Period adds budget to existing
  - Graph shows current levels of each category
  - Totals below each category
  - Transaction List for each category
  - Modify capacity for each category allows subtraction or addition of funds as used
  
Planned Features:
  - Multi-platform (phone)
  - Better interface
  - Only allow income then assign (for non-pay income)
  - Different views (Jars being filled)
  - Accounts linking/summary (Each category can link to account, so give sub-totals of different accounts for easy planning)
  - Linking profiles for overall summary
  - Convert to java/android
  - better storage of data
  - different pay cycles (e.g. fortnightly or set dates per month) with quick change
  - income calculator with tax and hours
  - incorporate into calendar, what each action costs or earns
  - fit into fitness/lifestyle planner (future program)
